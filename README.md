# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This is where I keep track of all the DSA problems I have solved and their solutions.
The problems are categorized by topic (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Dynamic Programming, etc.). Each file contains the problem statement and implemented solution, often accompanied by comments explaining the approach and logic used to solve the problem.
This folder serves as a personal repository for solving algorithmic challenges and improving problem-solving skills on LeetCode and HackerRank (mostly).
